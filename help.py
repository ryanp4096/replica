HELP_MESSAGE = '''**Welcome to Rz Fake**
To use Rz Fake, create a private thread in the channel you want to post to and add the Rz Fake bot. Rz Fake will not activate outside of private threads.

To switch to a character, use:
`>[profile name]`
The profile name is a shorthand for the character with no spaces, such as `squeak` or `az`. To see what profiles are available, use `;profiles`. Profiles and associated data are shared between all users.

You can also post just one message as a profile without switching using:
`>[profile name] [message]`

To change the profile's username and avatar, use:
`;username [username]`
`;avatar` and add attachment
`;avatar [url]`
Use `;preview` to preview what messages will look like.

Any message that is not a command will be sent to the main channel as the profile you are currently under. When you edit or delete these messages, the corresponding message in the main channel will also be edited or deleted.

Use `;help` to see this message again.'''
